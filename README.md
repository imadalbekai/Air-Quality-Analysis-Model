# Air-Quality-Analysis-Model
This is a machine learning project, a regression model, where I will be using regression models for predicting temperature, relative humidity or/and absolute humidity in some place in Italy from data like concentrations of some gases in that area; measured by chemical sensors, and also the time of the day.
